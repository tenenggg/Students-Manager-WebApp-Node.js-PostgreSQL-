 nullish coalescing operator ?? is used for defensive coding, so that it will not throws and error or crash the web
 the same as optional chaining which is single ?
 both are to check left side is nullish or undefined

 while ternary oeprator ahve the same look but always comes with ? and :, this used to comaparing and conditions
 which checks the (statemnet)? whether true or false, and if true will return leftside: if false will return :rightside







we also use expression functions a lot because there's a reasons

there's exist 3 type of functions that is declaration, declaration+assignment, expression
arrow function is the same as expression just a shorter version so its a expression type

so the only type u should be using is declaration or expression as declaration+assignment have too many cons 
like memory efficient(theres exist 2 callers variable), can be redeclared and undpredictable blockscope, but it is 
hoisted(the good one)

and the time u should be using definition is when u want to take advantages of the hoisting ONLY 
as it also have the same cons like declaration+assignment, which is can be redeclared and undpredictable blockscope, 
but the only good things about function declaration is it is hoisted and memory efiicient, as its have one callers

and the time u should be using expression is when u want for most of times because it haves:
memory efficient, can't be declared(less chance of mistakes), predictable block scope, can only exist in
block scope if u make it block scope (unlike definition, its inconsistent), and the only bad side is not hoisted,
so u need to assign first and call after.






we also use template strings for more efficient codes and cleaner codes
as when using template strings, u can call variable directly, if not using template strings, u need longer code 
to call the variable.
